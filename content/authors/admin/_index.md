My name is Fereshteh Forghani. I am a first-year Computer Science Master's student at York University under the supervision of [Dr. Marcus Brubaker](https://mbrubake.github.io/). I am interested in computer vision and deep learning. Specifically, I am interested in methods that can use unlabeled data in the learning process. This includes generative models and self-supervised learning methods. Previously, I did my Bachelor's at Sharif University of Technology, majoring in Computer Engineering.
