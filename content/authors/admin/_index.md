My name is Fereshteh Forghani and I am a senior B.Sc. student at Sharif University of Technology. My main interests are Machine Learning , Deep Learning, and their applications in Computer Vision and Medical Image Analysis. 

I intend to widen my knowledge in these areas by learning more about their theoretical and mathematical side and by practical exploitation of these methods in real-life problems. My research goal is to introduce innovative approaches based on mathematical reasoning that solve practical problems in computer perception and motion.
