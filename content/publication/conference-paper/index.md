abstract: This project aim to find natural adversarial examples to test the reliability of human trajectory predictors using density estimation techniques. First, we conducted a litrature review on density estimation techniques, such as [Masked autoregressive flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07057), [RealNVP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803) and [Masked autoencoder for distribution estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03509). We proceed by using Masked autoregressive flow(MAF) to find natural adversarial examples to test the reliability of human trajectory predictors. Subsequently, we adversarially trained LSTM based predictors and reduced the collision rate up to **35%** in the case of adversarial attack on test data.
